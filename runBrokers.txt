To run the broker overlay architecture:

Must create 3 projects, called broker1, broker2, broker3, the settings are in here https://github.com/cipriancus/socialistEBS/tree/routing-alg/broker/src/main/resources/brokers_ymls

and they must be but in resources so they can take the settings

broker2 is the "master" so you have to open broker1 and 3 first an then broker2

you must wait for the sincronization and the broker 2 must output something like this:

Broker has responded 127.0.0.1:8888
Broker has responded 127.0.0.1:8890
I know broker 127.0.0.1:8888
I know broker 127.0.0.1:8890
Broker has responded 127.0.0.1:8888
Broker has responded 127.0.0.1:8890

Broker has responded 127.0.0.1:8890
I know broker 127.0.0.1:8888
I know broker 127.0.0.1:8890
Broker has responded 127.0.0.1:8888
Broker has responded 127.0.0.1:8890
I know broker 127.0.0.1:8888
I know broker 127.0.0.1:8890

this means it can see 2 nodes

the subscriber will subscribe and then you can run the publisher

they can push to any nodes, preferably the shouldn't be on the same on, i'd put them one on 8888 and one on 8890 so the req goes through 8889
